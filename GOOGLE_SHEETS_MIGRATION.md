# Google Sheets Migration for FormFlowService

## Overview

The `FormFlowService` has been migrated from using local file storage to Google Sheets for storing `active_forms` and `poll_data`. This change provides better data accessibility, consistency with the rest of the application, and improved scalability.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Dependencies
- Removed `FileStorageService` import and usage
- Removed `self.file_storage` instance variable

### 2. New Google Sheets Structure

#### ActiveForms Sheet
- **Sheet Name**: `ActiveForms`
- **Columns**:
  - `user_id`: Unique identifier for the user
  - `form_data`: JSON string containing the complete form state
  - `created_at`: Timestamp when the form was first created
  - `updated_at`: Timestamp when the form was last updated

#### PollData Sheet
- **Sheet Name**: `PollData`
- **Columns**:
  - `poll_id`: Unique identifier for the poll
  - `poll_data`: JSON string containing the complete poll information
  - `created_at`: Timestamp when the poll was first created
  - `updated_at`: Timestamp when the poll was last updated

### 3. New Methods Added

#### Active Forms Management
- `get_form_by_user_id(user_id: str) -> Optional[FormState]`: Get a specific form by user ID
- `_remove_form_from_sheets(user_id: str) -> bool`: Remove a form from Google Sheets
- `_ensure_active_forms_sheet_exists() -> None`: Ensure the ActiveForms sheet exists

#### Poll Data Management
- **NEW**: `PollDataService` - Dedicated service for all poll data operations
- **MIGRATED**: All poll data methods moved from FormFlowService to PollDataService

### 4. Updated Methods

#### `get_active_forms()`
- Now reads from Google Sheets instead of file storage
- Automatically creates the sheet if it doesn't exist
- Handles JSON parsing of form data

#### `save_active_forms()`
- Now saves to Google Sheets instead of file storage
- Updates existing forms or creates new ones
- Maintains timestamps for creation and updates

#### `initialize()`
- Now ensures both ActiveForms and PollData sheets exist
- Called automatically during service initialization

## Usage Examples

### Working with Active Forms

```python
# Get all active forms
active_forms = form_flow_service.get_active_forms()

# Get a specific form
form = form_flow_service.get_form_by_user_id("user123")

# Save forms (automatically called when forms are modified)
form_flow_service.save_active_forms()

# Remove a completed form
form_flow_service._remove_form_from_sheets("user123")
```

### Working with Poll Data

```python
# Save poll data
poll_data = {"poll1": {"question": "Test?", "options": ["Yes", "No"]}}
# Use PollDataService for efficient saving
if len(poll_data) == 1:
    poll_id, poll_info = next(iter(poll_data.items()))
    form_flow_service.poll_data_service.save_single_poll(poll_id, poll_info)
else:
    form_flow_service.poll_data_service.save_multiple_polls(poll_data)

# Load all poll data
all_polls = form_flow_service.load_poll_data()

# Get a specific poll
poll = form_flow_service.get_poll_by_id("poll1")

# Remove poll data
form_flow_service.remove_poll_data("poll1")
```

## Data Migration

### From File Storage to Google Sheets

If you have existing data in file storage, you can migrate it using:

```python
# For active forms
old_forms = file_storage.load_data("active_forms", {})
for user_id, form_data in old_forms.items():
    form_state = FormState.from_dict(form_data)
    form_flow_service.active_forms[user_id] = form_state
form_flow_service.save_active_forms()

# For poll data
old_polls = file_storage.load_data("poll_data", {})
# Use PollDataService for efficient saving
if len(old_polls) == 1:
    poll_id, poll_info = next(iter(old_polls.items()))
    form_flow_service.poll_data_service.save_single_poll(poll_id, poll_info)
else:
    form_flow_service.poll_data_service.save_multiple_polls(old_polls)
```

## Benefits

1. **Centralized Storage**: All data is now stored in Google Sheets alongside other application data
2. **Better Accessibility**: Data can be accessed from anywhere, not just the local server
3. **Consistency**: Uses the same storage mechanism as Users, Events, and Registrations
4. **Scalability**: No local file size limitations or disk space concerns
5. **Backup**: Google Sheets provides automatic backup and version control
6. **Collaboration**: Multiple team members can view and manage data
7. **Service Separation**: Poll data management is now handled by a dedicated, specialized service
8. **Enhanced Functionality**: Advanced poll querying, statistics, and management capabilities

## Error Handling

The service includes comprehensive error handling:
- Automatic sheet creation if they don't exist
- Graceful fallbacks if sheet operations fail
- Detailed logging for debugging
- JSON parsing error handling

## Performance Considerations

- Data is loaded into memory on service initialization
- Changes are saved to Google Sheets when `save_active_forms()` is called
- Consider implementing caching for frequently accessed data
- Large amounts of data may require pagination or filtering

## Testing

The new Google Sheets-based storage can be tested by:
1. Creating test forms and polls
2. Verifying data persistence across service restarts
3. Testing concurrent access scenarios
4. Validating JSON serialization/deserialization
5. Testing error conditions (network issues, invalid data, etc.)

## New PollDataService

A dedicated `PollDataService` has been created to handle all poll data operations. This service provides:

### Features
- **Complete CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete polls
- **Advanced Querying**: Search polls by creator, type, status, and content
- **Statistics & Analytics**: Comprehensive poll statistics and reporting
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Remove expired polls automatically
- **Flexible Data Structure**: Support for different poll types (poll, quiz, survey)

### Integration
The PollDataService is integrated with FormFlowService and can be used independently:

```python
# In FormFlowService
self.poll_data_service = PollDataService(sheets_service)

# Usage examples
success = self.poll_data_service.create_poll("poll_id", poll_info)
poll = self.poll_data_service.get_poll_by_id("poll_id")
stats = self.poll_data_service.get_poll_statistics()
```
